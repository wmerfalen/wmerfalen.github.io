		<h1>Why I recommend everyone read the K&amp;R C book</h1>
		<p>It is a little known fact that the K&amp;R C book is one of the best books to read <b>when you are learning the C programming language</b>. 
		But that's not even remotely true, if you ask me. I firmly believe that every coder should read this timeless classic.
		It's not because I'm a staunch proponent of learning systems development. It hardly even has anything to do with loving the C++ programming
		language. The reason I recommend the K&amp;R book is because it is from the point of view of a language designer <b>and</b> a hardcore
		pragmatist.
